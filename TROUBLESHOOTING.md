# Troubleshooting: "Content of the page cannot be displayed"

## Quick Diagnosis Steps

### 1. Check Deployment Status
First, verify if the site is actually deployed on Netlify:

1. **Login to Netlify** → Go to your site dashboard
2. **Check Deploy Status** → Look for "Published" status (not "Deploy failed")
3. **Check Deploy Log** → Look for any error messages during build
4. **Test Netlify URL** → Try accessing your-site-name.netlify.app directly

### 2. Domain Configuration Issues

**DNS Not Propagated Yet**
- DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
- Test with [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org) using your domain
- Try accessing the site from different networks/devices

**Incorrect DNS Records**
```bash
# Check current DNS with:
nslookup www.medicalterminologyhub.com
nslookup medicalterminologyhub.com

# Should show Netlify's IP addresses
```

**Required DNS Settings:**
```
Type: A Record
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
```

### 3. Force HTTPS Issues

If you enabled "Force HTTPS" before DNS was fully configured:
1. **Disable Force HTTPS** temporarily in Netlify
2. **Wait for DNS propagation**
3. **Re-enable Force HTTPS** after domain works

### 4. Build/Deployment Issues

**Check Build Logs in Netlify:**
1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click on latest deploy
3. Look for errors in build log

**Common Build Issues:**
- Missing dependencies
- TypeScript errors (our build should skip these)
- Memory issues during build

### 5. Browser/Cache Issues

**Clear Browser Cache:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Try in incognito/private mode
- Try different browsers

**Disable Browser Extensions:**
- Ad blockers might interfere
- Try with all extensions disabled

### 6. Network/ISP Issues

**Try Different Networks:**
- Mobile data vs WiFi
- Different ISP
- VPN to different location

**Check Firewall/Antivirus:**
- Corporate firewalls might block
- Antivirus software interference

## Step-by-Step Recovery

### Option 1: Quick Fix - Direct Netlify URL
1. Find your Netlify URL: `https://[random-name].netlify.app`
2. Test if this URL works
3. If yes, issue is domain-related
4. If no, issue is deployment-related

### Option 2: Manual Deploy Test
1. Download this repository
2. Run: `npm install && npm run build`
3. Go to Netlify → Sites → "Add new site"
4. Drag and drop the `dist` folder
5. Test the preview URL

### Option 3: Fresh Deployment
1. Delete current Netlify site
2. Create new site from Git
3. Connect to this repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: 18

### Option 4: Domain Reset
1. Remove custom domain from Netlify
2. Test with .netlify.app URL
3. Re-add custom domain after confirming site works
4. Update DNS records again

## Build Command Verification

Make sure Netlify is using the correct build command:

**In netlify.toml (already configured):**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npx astro build"
  publish = "dist"
```

**Alternative commands to try:**
```bash
# If the above fails, try:
npm ci && npm run build

# Or force clean install:
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install && npm run build
```

## Environment Variables

Our project doesn't require environment variables, but if issues persist, try adding:

```
NODE_VERSION=18
NPM_VERSION=8
```

## Emergency Fallback

If all else fails, here's a minimal HTML version to test:

1. Create a simple `index.html` in the repository root
2. Add basic content to verify deployment works
3. Once deployment is confirmed working, revert to full application

## Contact Support

If none of these steps work:
1. **Netlify Support** - Check community forums
2. **Domain Registrar** - Verify DNS is correctly configured  
3. **ISP Support** - Check if there are any network restrictions

## Status Verification Tools

- **Website Status**: [downforeveryoneorjustme.com](http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com)
- **DNS Propagation**: [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)
- **SSL Check**: [ssllabs.com/ssltest](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
- **Page Speed**: [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

Most issues are resolved by waiting for DNS propagation or checking the direct Netlify URL first.
