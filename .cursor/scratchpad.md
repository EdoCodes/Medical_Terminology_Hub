# Medical Terminology Hub - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The Medical Terminology Hub is an interactive, open-source web application built with Astro and Tailwind CSS. It provides medical students, nurses, and healthcare professionals with an educational platform for learning medical terminology through:

- Interactive flashcards with terms, definitions, and clinical examples
- Smart search functionality for real-time filtering
- Progress tracking and study statistics
- Categorized learning by medical systems (Cardio, Neuro, Derm, etc.)
- Accessibility-first design with WCAG compliance
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

The project appears to be in a functional state with successful builds and multiple page routes already implemented.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Current State Assessment:**
- ✅ Build system working correctly (npm run build successful)
- ✅ Multiple page routes implemented (31 pages built)
- ✅ Core structure in place (components, pages, data, layouts)
- ✅ Multiple versions of pages exist (clean, old, original variants)
- ✅ Admin dashboard and blog functionality present
- ✅ Category-based routing working (/cardiovascular, /respiratory, etc.)

**Potential Areas for Improvement:**
- Multiple page variants suggest ongoing refactoring/cleanup needed
- Need to verify current functionality and user experience
- May need to consolidate page versions and remove outdated files
- Should verify all features mentioned in README are working
- Need to check for any broken links or missing functionality
